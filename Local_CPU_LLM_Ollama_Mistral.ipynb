       "\" The reason why the sky appears blue during a clear day is due to a particular type of scattering called Rayleigh scattering. When the sun's rays enter Earth's atmosphere, they are made up of various wavelengths or colors of light. Short-wavelength light, such as blue and violet, gets scattered more easily because they have smaller wavelengths. This scattered blue light is what we see when we look at the sky. However, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and less sensitive to violet light, making the sky appear more blue than violet. At sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on a variety of colors because the angles of the sunlight entering the atmosphere cause different types of scattering to occur.\""
